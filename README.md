Project Name: Plantastic

Team Name: RootForce

Team Members: Mirella, Amelia, Natalie

Project Description: This is a team project for CSI-2300, where all three members contribute their strengths and knowledge of computere science to create a JavaFX project. 
                    The basis of this project is to teach users about the benefits that plants have on the enviroment, while also bringing a bit of entertainment to the ta-
                    ble. This will be a clicker game where the user must begin by clicking the start button. The user will grow the plants they collect by clicking on them. 
                    With each click of your plant, oxygen is being released into the atmosphere due to photosynthesis. Therefore the user will be purifying  the air with each 
                    click along with gaining points to increase their Eco-Friendly Meter. After the start, the user will have the option to choose between three different ca-
                    tegories of Plants. To unlock another plant the user must level up by reaching that plants allotted Eco-friendly target. 

Estimate of Effort: This Plantastic project is expected to be completed within 3.5 weeks. Each project member will be completeing a portion of this project. This JavaFX clicker
                    game will involve developing a responsive GUI, coding interactive elements like plant growth and point tracking, and implementing features for plant selection,
                    leveling, and the Eco-Friendly Meter.
