Project Name: Plantastic

Team Name: RootForce

Team Members: Mirella, Amelia, Natalie

Project Description: This is a team project for CSI-2300, where all three members contribute their strengths and knowledge of computer science to create a JavaFX project. The basis of this project is to teach users about the benefits that plants have on the enviroment, while also bringing a bit of entertainment to the table. This will be a clicker game where the user must begin by clicking the start button. The user will grow the plants they collect by clicking on them. With each click of your plant, oxygen is being released into the atmosphere due to photosynthesis. Therefore the user will be purifying the air with each click along with gaining points to increase their Eco-Friendly Meter to unlock new plants. After the start, the user will have the option to grow 3 plants at level 1, one plant from each of the three different categories of plants will be available.The plant categories include: Trees, Flowers and House Plants. To unlock more plants the user must level up on the Eco-Friendly Meter by growing the plants they already have. Once the user reaches a new level, then another row of plants will be availble.

Estimate of Effort: This Plantastic project is expected to be completed within 3.5 weeks. Each project member will be completeing a portion of this project. This JavaFX clicker game will involve developing a responsive GUI, coding interactive elements like plant growth and point tracking, and implementing features for plant selection, leveling, and the Eco-Friendly Meter.
